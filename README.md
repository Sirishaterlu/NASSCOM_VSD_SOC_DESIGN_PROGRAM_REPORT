# Introduction to Open-Source EDA, OpenLANE, and Sky130 PDK

## Overview
This section presents a detailed introduction to integrated circuit design fundamentals, covering packaging methodologies, die architecture, foundry operations, and the software-to-hardware translation process. It emphasizes the critical role of RTL in hardware design and outlines the open-source ASIC design ecosystem.

## Computer Architecture Fundamentals

### Chip Packaging and Structure
* Modern embedded systems incorporate integrated circuits (ICs) housed within protective packages, facilitating board mounting and handling. The primary interconnection method employed is wire bonding.
* The chip architecture consists of:
  * I/O clearing zones for pad placement
  * Core area for main circuit implementation
  * Die area encompassing both components
  * Wire bond connections linking I/O pads to external interfaces

### Manufacturing and IP Integration
* Foundries serve as manufacturing facilities for ICs and provide Intellectual Property (IP) blocks in both soft and hard macro formats
* Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) represents the final human-readable code layer before machine code conversion
* Standard compilation flow: C code ‚Üí Assembly ‚Üí Machine code
* RTL serves as the hardware implementation model for ISA execution

## System-on-Chip Design and OpenLANE Framework

### Essential Components
The open-source ASIC design implementation requires three fundamental elements:
1. RTL Designs
2. EDA Tools
3. PDK (Process Design Kit) Data

### ASIC Implementation Flow
OpenLANE orchestrates the following sequential steps:
1. **Synthesis**: Converts RTL to PDK-specific physical library netlist
2. **Floorplan & Power Planning**: Establishes die dimensions, pin configuration, and power distribution
3. **Placement**: Positions standard cells within core region
4. **Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS)**: Implements clock distribution network
5. **Routing**: Establishes signal interconnections
6. **Sign-off**: Performs DRC, LVS, timing verification, and GDS generation

## Laboratory Exercise: Open-Source EDA Tools Familiarization

### Environment Setup
* Working Directory: `~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane`
* Design Directory: `~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/design`
* Target Design: `picorv32a`
* Configuration Priority: Design-specific `config.tcl` overrides default tool parameters

### OpenLANE Initialization
```bash
docker                    # Initialize Docker container
./flows.tcl -interactive  # Launch OpenLANE interface
package require openlane 0.9  # Load OpenLANE 0.9
prep -design picorv32a    # Initialize picorv32a design
```

### Synthesis Execution
```bash
run_synthesis  # Execute synthesis and ABC optimization
```

### Results Analysis
* Generated files are organized in the following structure:
  * `results/`: Contains synthesized netlist
  * `reports/`: Houses synthesis reports
  * `logs/`: Stores execution logs
  * Note: Most recent reports represent the current state

### Design Analysis
#### Flip-Flop Ratio Calculation
```math
Flip-Flop\ Ratio = \frac{Number\ of\ D\ Flip-Flops}{Total\ Number\ of\ Cells}
```
```math
DFF\ Percentage = Flip-Flop\ Ratio \times 100
```

#### Example Calculation
Based on `reports/synthesis/1-yosys_4.stat.rpt`:
```math
DFF\ Percentage = \frac{1613}{14876} \times 100 = 10.84\%
```

Additional analysis can be performed using STA reports and Yosys usage summaries.

## Sky130 Day 1 - Introduction to Open-Source EDA, OpenLANE, and Sky130 PDK

**Summary:**
This section introduces the fundamentals of chip packaging, die structure, the role of foundries and IPs, and the flow from C code to machine code. It emphasizes the importance of RTL in hardware design and provides an overview of the open-source ASIC design ecosystem.

## üìå SKY130_D1_SK1 - How to Talk to Computers

- Chips are packaged for easier mounting on embedded boards. Common packaging method: **Wire Bonding**.
- The chip contains:
  - **I/O Clearance Area**: Hosts I/O pads
  - **Core Area**: Contains logic and memory
  - All within the **Die Area**
- **Foundries** manufacture chips and may provide **IP blocks** (hard/soft macros).
- **ISA (Instruction Set Architecture)**: Assembly code just above machine language.
- Typical software-to-hardware flow:  
  `C code ‚Üí Assembly ‚Üí Machine code`
- **RTL** models hardware logic that runs the ISA-defined instructions.

---

## üèóÔ∏è SKY130_D1_SK2 - SoC Design and OpenLANE Flow

To build open-source ASICs, we need:

1. RTL Designs (e.g., Verilog)
2. Open-source EDA tools (e.g., Yosys, OpenROAD)
3. PDK (e.g., Sky130)

### üîÑ OpenLANE ASIC Design Flow:

1. **Synthesis**  
   Converts RTL to gate-level netlist using standard cells.
2. **Floorplan & Powerplan**  
   Defines die size, pin/pad placement, and power domains.
3. **Placement**  
   Places cells within the core.
4. **CTS (Clock Tree Synthesis)**  
   Distributes the clock to sequential elements.
5. **Routing**  
   Connects all logic using metal layers.
6. **Signoff**  
   Performs DRC, LVS, STA. Generates final GDSII file.

## üß™ LAB: SKY130_D1_SK3 - OpenLane Hands-On with `picorv32a`

* Enter the dir `~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane` all openlane runs must happen from this directory.
* the design folder `~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/design` holds the data for RTL2GDSII implementation, we focus on `picorv32a`. the `config.tcl` inside the designs have the highest priority and the cmds mentioned in them override the default commands in the tools
* To open the openlane instance:
  ```bash
  docker
  # calls the docker instance for the openlane
  ./flows.tcl -interactive
  # opens openlane terminal
  package require openlane 0.9
  # calls openlane 0.9
  prep -design picorv32a
  # prepares Picorv32a design for implemtation
  ```
  ![Screenshot from 2025-03-27 14-08-29]([File\1.jpeg](https://github.com/Sirishaterlu/report/blob/main/File/1.jpeg))

* after this `runs` dir willbe created in the `designs/picorv32a` folder
  ![Screenshot from 2025-03-27 14-10-38]([File\2.jpeg](https://github.com/Sirishaterlu/report/blob/main/File/2.jpeg))
* inside the run directory the folders will be created as the runs are done
  ![run dir]([File\3.jpeg](https://github.com/Sirishaterlu/report/blob/main/File/3.jpeg))
* there is one `config.tcl` which is diffrent from the other config file discussed before, this one shows which default parameters are being taken bt=y the runs
* Running synthesis:
  ```bash
  run_synthesis
  # runs synthesis and abc's
  ```
* after the run we can check the run dir for the results, logs and reports. `results` folder must have the synthesized netlsit. `reports` folder will have all the reports for synthesis step and `logs` will store all the run logs for synthesis. in the `reports` chronologically latest report is most accurate 
  ![runs folder content]([File\4.jpeg](https://github.com/Sirishaterlu/report/blob/main/File/4.jpeg))

* At this step we need to do DFF ratio calculation as follows:
```math
Flip Flop\ Ratio = \frac{Number\ of\ D\ Flip\ Flops}{Total\ Number\ of\ Cells}
```
```math
Percentage\ of\ DFF's = Flip Flop\ Ratio * 100
```
* checking for latest file we have `reports/synthesis/1-yosys_4.stat.rpt` from dir image above. Therefore Flip Flop ratio is:
```math
Percentage\ of\ DFF's = \frac{1613}{14876} * 100 = 10.84 %
```
* we can also analyse the sta reports along with the yosys usage summary
  
# Sky130 Day 2 - Floorplanning, Power Delivery, and Library Cells

## üß† Overview

This session explores key concepts in floorplanning, power distribution strategies, pin placements, and pre-placed cells. It also introduces how standard cells from libraries are bound and placed using OpenLANE.

---

## üìê SKY130_D2_SK1 - Chip Floorplanning Considerations

### Key Definitions:

- **Floorplanning** defines the physical layout and area of the chip.
- The **absolute minimum area** is estimated based on cell dimensions (e.g., standard cells, flip-flops).

```math
Utilization = \frac{Area\ utilized\ by\ netlist}{Total\ core\ area}
```
and 

```math
Aspect\ Ratio= \frac{Heigth of core}{Width of core}
```
* with abs min area known, we need to account for area occupied by routing metals.
## (March/28/2025)
* **üß± Preplaced Cells** : top level logic is broken into mutiple cuts and are implemented separately
* Large reusable blocks (e.g., ALUs, comparators, muxes) can be implemented as preplaced IP blocks.
*These cells are black-boxed and fixed in the layout before regular cell placement.
*Decoupling Cells are placed around them to maintain stable voltage during power fluctuations by acting as capacitors.
  
* **decoupling  cells** help maintain stable supply voltage across the logic they are placed near , by provding capacitive charging effect in the event of supply voltage drop due to reistance on the pwr supply path
* **üîå Power Planning**:
* A single power source leads to voltage drops in large circuits.
* Power Meshes are used to distribute power efficiently across the chip.
* **üìç Pin Placement**:
* Pin positioning should reflect signal flow and reduce routing complexity.
* A good understanding of internal logic is required for optimal pin placement.
## LAB : floorplan and placement
* `:~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/configuration` contains the tool default configurations and `README.md` filde inside that folder lists all the diffrent config variables avaible for the designer
* priority : `:~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/configuration` < `design/runs/config.tcl` < `design/PDK.tcl`

```
```math
Area\ of\ die\ in\ microns = \frac{660.685 * 671.405}{1000 * 1000} = 443587.21\ Microns^2
```

* we can view the floorplan generated with the help of `magic` tool

### SKY130_D2_SK2 - Library Binding and Placement

* **Library**: contains diffrent flavours of cells, timing, functionality informations
* Placing the netlist elements in core area from floorplan stage is **placement**
* When the placement is done its wrt the pin placement, estimated resistance, capacitances of the interconeects . signal Transition analysis is done to see if the placed cells are recievin the signals on time, if not buffers are added to improve the transition.

### SKY130_D3_SK3 - Sky130 Tech File Labs (March/31/2025)
#### ngspice sim for cell characterization

* After the cell layout is created we need to do characterization (timing , noise)
* timimng characterization is sone after extracting the device parasitics and R,C and running simulatioms
* here for inv cell we do transient analysis to find rise , fall transition, cell delay  

### LAB
* To perform the simulation, follow these steps to create the SPICE deck.
### Steps to Prepare the SPICE Deck:
1. Export the SPICE netlist from Magic (using the ext2spice tool).
2. Modify the SPICE netlist to prepare it for simulation:
 * Add library paths where the PMOS and NMOS models are stored.
 * Define grid dimensions for the simulation environment.
 * Verify that the correct names for PMOS and NMOS models are used (e.g., sky130_fd_pr__nfet_01v8, sky130_fd_pr__pfet_01v8).
 * Add power (VDD) and ground (VSS) connections.
 * Connect the input signal and output nodes properly.
 * Define the type of simulation (in this case, transient analysis) and set the parameters for it.

## Sky130 Day 4 - Pre-layout Timing Analysis and Importance of Good Clock Tree
# SKY130_D4_SK1 - Timing Modeling Using Delay Tables
### April/2/2025
* A Timing Table is used to model the delay of a cell relative to the input transition and output load. This helps in estimating how long a signal takes to propagate through the cell, depending on how fast the input changes and the load it drives at the output.
* To insert the custom design (e.g., sky130_vsdinv) into the OpenLane flow, we need the characterized library (which includes the timing, power, and area data) and LEF (Library Exchange Format) files. These files contain information about the cells, their layout, and other physical attributes necessary for physical design tools.
* These library files are usually obtained and generated from the Magic GUI, which can extract the required timing and parasitic data from the design layout.
  
```
# rename the cell design
save <new name>.mag

save sky130_vsdinv.mag

# open the design in new gui and write lef
write lef <optional name, default is the design name in the gui>
```

* copy `lib` and `lef` files to `design/<designanme>/src` folder

* edit the `design/config.tcl` file to include the paths to the new `lib`, `lef` in src folder. This ensures openlane flow picks the new lib and lef
```tcl

Changing the variables in openlane terminal
```tcl
# Command to display current value of variable SYNTH_STRATEGY
echo $::env(SYNTH_STRATEGY)

# Command to set new value for SYNTH_STRATEGY
set ::env(SYNTH_STRATEGY) "DELAY 3"

echo $::env(SYNTH_BUFFERING)

# Command to display current value of variable SYNTH_SIZING, if enabled =1
echo $::env(SYNTH_SIZING)

# Command to set new value for SYNTH_SIZING
set ::env(SYNTH_SIZING) 1

# Command to display current value of variable SYNTH_DRIVING_CELL to check whether it's the proper cell or not

### SKY130_D4_SK2 - Timing Analysis with Ideal Clocks Using OpenSTA
#### April/03/2025
*Setup Analysis:*
* Setup analysis determines the minimum time a data signal must be stable before the active clock edge to ensure that the flip-flop can capture the data correctly. If this setup time is not met, the data may be incorrectly latched.
*Clock Jitter:*
* Clock jitter refers to the deviation of a clock signal's edges from their ideal positions. This can be caused by noise, power supply fluctuations, or imperfections in the clock distribution network. Jitter can result in timing violations, where the data may not be captured correctly by flip-flops.
*Clock Uncertainty:*
* Clock uncertainty includes all sources of timing variation that affect the synchronization of data signals. This encompasses clock jitter as well as other factors like skew (the difference in arrival times of the clock at different points in the design), and process variations (differences in the manufacturing process that can cause timing inconsistencies).
* These uncertainty values are incorporated into the slack calculations for setup and hold checks. By adding pessimism to the design, clock uncertainty makes sure the design is robust under less-than-ideal conditions. This results in more conservative timing analysis, ensuring that even with variations, the design will work correctly.

OAI cell of drive strenght 2 has more delay:
* changing drive stenght to 3 returns the message "Warning: liberty cell 'sky130_fd_sc_hd__o21bai_3' not found."
* changing the drive strenght to 4

to check the timimg through a cell we changed
```tcl
report_checks -from _35312_ -to _35239_ -through _22380_
# report_checks -from _start_pont_net_id -to end_point_net_id -through cell_id
```

### writin the ecos to new netlist

keep the old netlist in different name
```bash
cd ~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a/runs/03-04_09-49/results/synthesis/

mv picorv32a.synthesis.v picorv32a.synthesis_old.v
```
 
Now write the new netlist in the opensta terminal

```tcl
write_verilog  write_verilog ~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a/runs/03-04_09-49/results/synthesis/picorv32a.synthesis.v
```
After this stage rerunning synthesis will erase all the good changes done in opensta tool. so after `write_verilog` cmd we can return to openalne cmdline and run

```tcl

#if "run_floorplan" command gives error, following cmds do the same
init_floorplan
place_io
tap_decap_or

# Now we are ready to run placement
run_placement

# With placement finished , run CTS
run_cts
```
After the cts , new .v file is creted in the synthesis results folder

### Sky130 Day 5 - Final Steps for RTL2GDS Using TritonRoute and OpenSTA
# Final Steps Overview:
On Day 5, the following key steps are performed as part of the final stages of the RTL2GDS flow:
3 steps are done here:
*1. Power Routing:*
* Normally, Power Delivery Network (PDN) creation is done during the floorplan stage. However, in the OpenLane flow, power routing is done at this stage. This is where power grid and supply connections to cells are established to ensure that each component gets proper power distribution throughout the chip.
* Proper power routing is crucial for the chip's operation, as insufficient power delivery or poor routing can cause reliability issues and timing failures due to voltage drops.
*2. Signal Routing with TritonRoute:*
*Signal routing refers to the interconnection of the cells (gates, flip-flops, etc.) with the metal layers that carry the signal between them. In this stage, TritonRoute is used for physical routing of signal connections.
* This step ensures that all the signal paths are properly connected, avoiding congestion or routing violations, which could affect chip performance.
*3. RC Extraction:*
* RC Extraction involves extracting the resistance (R) and capacitance (C) values of the interconnects (wires and vias) in the layout. This information is essential for post-layout timing analysis as these parasitic values impact the signal propagation speed, timing, and overall performance of the chip.
*4. Post-Route Timing Analysis with OpenSTA:*
* OpenSTA (Static Timing Analysis) is then used to perform post-route timing analysis. This step analyzes the timing of the design after the physical routing has been completed. It checks whether the design meets the required timing constraints, such as setup and hold times for flip-flops, and if the signal transitions occur within the allowed timing windows.
* The post-route timing analysis takes into account the RC delays from the extracted interconnects, which might not have been present in pre-route timing analysis. Any violations discovered at this stage will be fixed by adjusting the design or routing to ensure that all timing requirements are met.

PWR Routing:
```tcl

# check which def file openlane is currently pointing at , it should be pointing to CTS def
echo $::env(CURRENT_DEF)

# create PDN
